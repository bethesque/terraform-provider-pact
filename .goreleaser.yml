  # Changelog generation implementation to use.

  # Valid options are:
  # - `git`: uses `git log`;
  # - `github`: uses the compare GitHub API, appending the author login to the changelog.
  # - `gitlab`: uses the compare GitLab API, appending the author name and email to the changelog.
  # - `github-native`: uses the GitHub release notes generation API, disables the groups feature.
  #
  # Defaults to `git`.

  # Could either be asc, desc or empty
  # Default is empty

  # Group commits messages by given regex and title.
  # Order value defines the order of the groups.
  # Proving no regex means all commits will be grouped under the default group.
  # Groups are disabled when using github-native, as it already groups things by itself.
